**What you will get after Execution â†’ a CSV file (Predict.csv) that predicts if the users in input.csv will click on advertisement (or you can cut Training Set into Training, Testing and Validating to vertify the model)**

***Q: Why is it difficult?***

**Ans: Because most of the user won't click on advertisement, so the training data with click=1 is little. Machine can easily make high accuracy by predicting all users in input.csv won't click on the advertisement. That's the reason why we need f1 score to identify whether machine is good enough or not.**
